# RBCStockMarketApplication

The application to manage the following operations:
- upload a bulk stock transaction records in database
- add the single stock transaction record to database
- get All stock transaction Record from database
- query from database by stock ticker

for purpose of testing I used the r2dbc-h2.
please note we can't use the in-memory database in production and we need to use one of the commercial database like PostgreSQL

for purpose of testing Postman collection are added to the code base.
